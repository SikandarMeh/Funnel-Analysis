# Funnel-Analysis-Project
Analysing the Prism Website's Funnel


“conversion rate of the website (from visit to order) dropped dramatically overnight.”
“standard drop for a Sunday.”
“we need to understand these metrics a lot more. I currently have no visibility of each step of the web funnel, and wouldn’t understand what a normal drop off looks like?”
“really like sight of the general drivers of conversion rate and then talk about opportunities to optimise them. It would be great to benchmark ourselves against the industry and competitors.”
